# How to use rtpengine with docker 

## What is rtpengine? 

RTPengine is a proxy for RTP traffic and other UDP based media 
traffic over either IPv4 or IPv6. It can even bridge between diff 
IP networks and interfaces. It can do TOS/QoS field setting. It is 
Multi-threaded , can advertise different addresses for operation behind NAT.

It bears in-kernel packet forwarding for low-latency and low-CPU performance.

### In-Kernel Packet Forwarding

To avoid the overhead involved in processing each individual RTP packet in 
userspace-only operation, especially as RTP traffic consists of many small 
packets at high rates, rtpengine provides a kernel module to offload the bulk 
of the packet forwarding duties from user space to kernel space. This also 
results in increasing the number of concurrent calls as CPU usage decreases.
In-kernel packet forwarding is implemented as an iptables module (`x_tables`) 
and has 2 parts â€“ `xt_RTPENGINE` and plugin to the iptables and ip6tables 
command-line utilities.

### Kernel Module

The kernel module supports multiple forwarding tables, identified through 
their ID number , bydefault 0 to 63.

### iptables module 

In order for the kernel module to be able to actually forward packets, an 
iptables rule must be set up to send packets into the module. Each such 
rule is associated with one forwarding table. 

# ng Control Protocol

In order to enable several advanced features in rtpengine, a new advanced 
control protocol has been devised which passes the complete SDP body from 
the SIP proxy to the rtpengine daemon, has the body rewritten in the daemon, 
and then passed back to the SIP proxy to embed into the SIP message.

This control protocol is based on the bencode standard and runs over UDP 
transport. Bencoding supports a similar feature set as the more popular 
JSON encoding (dictionaries/hashes, lists/arrays, arbitrary byte strings) 
but offers some benefits over JSON encoding, e.g. simpler and more efficient 
encoding, less encoding overhead, deterministic encoding and faster encoding 
and decoding. A disadvantage over JSON is that it's not a readily human readable format.

Each message passed between the SIP proxy and the media proxy contains of 
two parts: a message cookie, and a bencoded dictionary, separated by a single 
space. The message cookie serves the same purpose as in the control protocol 
used by Kamailio's rtpproxy module: matching requests to responses, and 
retransmission detection. The message cookie in the response generated to a 
particular request therefore must be the same as in the request.

The dictionary of each request must contain at least one key called command. 
The corresponding value must be a string and determines the type of message.

The response dictionary must contain at least one key called `result`. The 
value can be either `ok` or `error`. For the `ping` command, the additional value 
`pong` is allowed. If the result is `error`, then another key `error-reason` must 
be given, containing a string with a human-readable error message. No other 
keys should be present in the error case. If the result is `ok`, the optional 
key `warning` may be present, containing a human-readable warning message. 
This can be used for non-fatal errors.

For readability, all data objects below are represented in a JSON-like 
notation and without the message cookie. For example, a `ping` message and 
its corresponding `pong` reply would be written as:

```
{ "command": "ping" }
{ "result": "pong" }
```

All keys and values are case-sensitive unless specified otherwise. The 
requirement stipulated by the bencode standard that dictionary keys must 
be present in lexicographical order is not currently honoured.

## Set up docker for rtpengine 

You have to define a new docker network, but you can use the default with 
a specific ip address. 

```bash
docker network create --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 rtpengine
```

## Run rtpengine basic

```bash
docker run --net rtpengine --ip 172.18.0.22 -it drachtio/rtpengine rtpengine
```

Now you can connect to this and check if it is runnig. The contatiener will listen
on `172.18.0.22:22222`. 

## Simple client


``` javascript
const Client = require('rtpengine-client').Client ;
const client = new Client() ;

client.ping(22222, '172.18.0.22')
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(`received ${JSON.stringify(res)}`); // {result: 'pong'}
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log(`Error: ${err}`);
  })
```

## Try to send traffic to rtpengine

```
ffmpeg -re -i Recording.amr -ar 8000 -f mulaw -f rtp rtp://172.18.0.22:22222
```

Tried with `wav`, `m4a` and `amr`, but every time I get this:

```
WARNING: Received invalid data on NG port (no cookie)
```

In theory the rtpengine supports `amr` codec. 

## Misc

### SDP: Session Description Protocol (RFC4566)

When initiating multimedia teleconferences, voice-over-IP calls,
streaming video, or other sessions, there is a requirement to convey
media details, transport addresses, and other session description
metadata to the participants.

SDP provides a standard representation for such information,
irrespective of how that information is transported.  SDP is purely a
format for session description -- it does not incorporate a transport
protocol, and it is intended to use different transport protocols as
appropriate, including the Session Announcement Protocol [14],
Session Initiation Protocol [15], Real Time Streaming Protocol [16],
electronic mail using the MIME extensions, and the Hypertext
Transport Protocol.

###  SIP: Session Initiation Protocol (RFC3261)

There are many applications of the Internet that require the creation
and management of a session, where a session is considered an
exchange of data between an association of participants.  The
implementation of these applications is complicated by the practices
of participants: users may move between endpoints, they may be
addressable by multiple names, and they may communicate in several
different media - sometimes simultaneously.  Numerous protocols have
been authored that carry various forms of real-time multimedia
session data such as voice, video, or text messages.  The Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) works in concert with these protocols by
enabling Internet endpoints (called user agents) to discover one
another and to agree on a characterization of a session they would
like to share.  For locating prospective session participants, and
for other functions, SIP enables the creation of an infrastructure of
network hosts (called proxy servers) to which user agents can send
registrations, invitations to sessions, and other requests.  SIP is
an agile, general-purpose tool for creating, modifying, and
terminating sessions that works independently of underlying transport
protocols and without dependency on the type of session that is being
established.

#### SIP Offer/Answer model (RFC6337)

The offer/answer model itself is independent from the higher layer
application protocols that utilize it.  SIP is one of the
applications using the offer/answer model.  [RFC3264] defines the
offer/answer model, but does not specify which SIP messages should
convey an offer or an answer.  This should be defined in the SIP core
and extension RFCs.

In theory, any SIP message can include a session description in its
body.  But a session description in a SIP message is not necessarily
an offer or an answer.  Only certain session description usages that
conform to the rules described in Standards-Track RFCs can be
interpreted as an offer or an answer.  The rules for how to handle
the offer/answer model are defined in several RFCs.

The offer/answer model defines a mechanism for update of sessions.
In SIP, a dialog is used to associate an offer/answer exchange with
the session that it is to update.  In other words, only the offer/
answer exchange in the SIP dialog can update the session that is
managed by that dialog.
