# How to use rtpengine with docker 

## What is rtpengine? 

RTPengine is a proxy for RTP traffic and other UDP based media 
traffic over either IPv4 or IPv6. It can even bridge between diff 
IP networks and interfaces. It can do TOS/QoS field setting. It is 
Multi-threaded , can advertise different addresses for operation behind NAT.

It bears in-kernel packet forwarding for low-latency and low-CPU performance.

### In-Kernel Packet Forwarding

To avoid the overhead involved in processing each individual RTP packet in 
userspace-only operation, especially as RTP traffic consists of many small 
packets at high rates, rtpengine provides a kernel module to offload the bulk 
of the packet forwarding duties from user space to kernel space. This also 
results in increasing the number of concurrent calls as CPU usage decreases.
In-kernel packet forwarding is implemented as an iptables module (`x_tables`) 
and has 2 parts â€“ `xt_RTPENGINE` and plugin to the iptables and ip6tables 
command-line utilities.

### Kernel Module

The kernel module supports multiple forwarding tables, identified through 
their ID number , bydefault 0 to 63.

### iptables module 

In order for the kernel module to be able to actually forward packets, an 
iptables rule must be set up to send packets into the module. Each such 
rule is associated with one forwarding table. 

## Set up docker for rtpengine 

You have to define a new docker network, but you can use the default with 
a specific ip address. 

```bash
docker network create --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 rtpengine
```

## Run rtpengine basic

```bash
docker run --net rtpengine --ip 172.18.0.22 -it drachtio/rtpengine rtpengine
```

Now you can connect to this and check if it is runnig. The contatiener will listen
on `172.18.0.22:22222`. 

## Simple client


``` javascript
const Client = require('rtpengine-client').Client ;
const client = new Client() ;

client.ping(22222, '172.18.0.22')
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(`received ${JSON.stringify(res)}`); // {result: 'pong'}
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log(`Error: ${err}`);
  })
```
