# How to use rtpengine with docker 

## What is rtpengine? 

RTPengine is a proxy for RTP traffic and other UDP based media 
traffic over either IPv4 or IPv6. It can even bridge between diff 
IP networks and interfaces. It can do TOS/QoS field setting. It is 
Multi-threaded , can advertise different addresses for operation behind NAT.

It bears in-kernel packet forwarding for low-latency and low-CPU performance.

### In-Kernel Packet Forwarding

To avoid the overhead involved in processing each individual RTP packet in 
userspace-only operation, especially as RTP traffic consists of many small 
packets at high rates, rtpengine provides a kernel module to offload the bulk 
of the packet forwarding duties from user space to kernel space. This also 
results in increasing the number of concurrent calls as CPU usage decreases.
In-kernel packet forwarding is implemented as an iptables module (`x_tables`) 
and has 2 parts â€“ `xt_RTPENGINE` and plugin to the iptables and ip6tables 
command-line utilities.

### Kernel Module

The kernel module supports multiple forwarding tables, identified through 
their ID number , bydefault 0 to 63.

### iptables module 

In order for the kernel module to be able to actually forward packets, an 
iptables rule must be set up to send packets into the module. Each such 
rule is associated with one forwarding table. 

# ng Control Protocol

In order to enable several advanced features in rtpengine, a new advanced 
control protocol has been devised which passes the complete SDP body from 
the SIP proxy to the rtpengine daemon, has the body rewritten in the daemon, 
and then passed back to the SIP proxy to embed into the SIP message.

This control protocol is based on the bencode standard and runs over UDP 
transport. Bencoding supports a similar feature set as the more popular 
JSON encoding (dictionaries/hashes, lists/arrays, arbitrary byte strings) 
but offers some benefits over JSON encoding, e.g. simpler and more efficient 
encoding, less encoding overhead, deterministic encoding and faster encoding 
and decoding. A disadvantage over JSON is that it's not a readily human readable format.

Each message passed between the SIP proxy and the media proxy contains of 
two parts: a message cookie, and a bencoded dictionary, separated by a single 
space. The message cookie serves the same purpose as in the control protocol 
used by Kamailio's rtpproxy module: matching requests to responses, and 
retransmission detection. The message cookie in the response generated to a 
particular request therefore must be the same as in the request.

The dictionary of each request must contain at least one key called command. 
The corresponding value must be a string and determines the type of message.

The response dictionary must contain at least one key called `result`. The 
value can be either `ok` or `error`. For the `ping` command, the additional value 
`pong` is allowed. If the result is `error`, then another key `error-reason` must 
be given, containing a string with a human-readable error message. No other 
keys should be present in the error case. If the result is `ok`, the optional 
key `warning` may be present, containing a human-readable warning message. 
This can be used for non-fatal errors.

For readability, all data objects below are represented in a JSON-like 
notation and without the message cookie. For example, a `ping` message and 
its corresponding `pong` reply would be written as:

```
{ "command": "ping" }
{ "result": "pong" }
```

All keys and values are case-sensitive unless specified otherwise. The 
requirement stipulated by the bencode standard that dictionary keys must 
be present in lexicographical order is not currently honoured.

## Set up docker for rtpengine 

You have to define a new docker network, but you can use the default with 
a specific ip address. 

```bash
docker network create --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 rtpengine
```

## Run rtpengine basic

```bash
docker run --net rtpengine --ip 172.18.0.22 -it drachtio/rtpengine rtpengine
```

Now you can connect to this and check if it is runnig. The contatiener will listen
on `172.18.0.22:22222`. 

## Simple client


``` javascript
const Client = require('rtpengine-client').Client ;
const client = new Client() ;

client.ping(22222, '172.18.0.22')
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(`received ${JSON.stringify(res)}`); // {result: 'pong'}
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log(`Error: ${err}`);
  })
```
